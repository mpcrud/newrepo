 * The TdCityRepository is a data-centric service for the {@link TdCity} entity.

 * Search logic is driven by 2 kinds of parameters: a {@link TdCity} instance used
 * as a properties holder against which the search will be performed and a {@link SearchParameters}
 * instance from where you can control your search options including the usage
